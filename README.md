### <h1 style="font-weight:bold;">About the project</h1>

<p style="font-size:17px; font-weight:bold">For this project, we were asked to create an index page added to another 4 pages for a total of 5, with fully responsive content and implementing grid and flexbox.

I opted to create something simple: a fan page of a German soccer team with a home page containing club news in the form of cards, a gallery with images to which I added animations. A matches page where you can see detailed information about the club's matches, a squad page where by using a table you can find the team squad with detailed information, and finally a contact page with a small form. In almost all the pages grid and flexbox were used to give the content position and to make it fully responsive as requested in the project requirements.</p>
